![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

## What is this?

**L2T Overlay Chat Translator** is a free and open-source tool for Lineage 2 Masterwork (LU4) players.  
It lets you select your in-game chat window, then overlays instant, live Google translation right on your screen‚Äîwithout modifying the game.

- **Click-through overlay** (won't block your game!).
- **Easy region select** (drag and drop on startup or with a hotkey).
- **Overlay is movable**‚Äîjust hold `Ctrl+Alt` and drag.
- **Snaps back** to your chat region with one tray menu click.
- **System tray** for all settings: font, scan speed, logs, help, more!
- **Privacy-first:** Your screen is never sent anywhere except to Google Translate, for translation only.
